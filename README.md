## we developed a tool that leverages the SRA Toolkit for retrieving and managing BioProjects and BioSamples from the NCBI database. Guided by the PICO principles—Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome—our search strategy ensures the selection of relevant BioProjects. The process begins with inputting specific search criteria based on PICO, which returns a list of BioProjects. Once a BioProject is selected, detailed information about the associated BioSamples is displayed, including links to verify the data through SRA and BioSample records. Users can then download the corresponding SRA files in FASTQ format. The tool is implemented using Python, utilizing APIs and XML files to manage data retrieval and parsing.

## Key features include:
------------------------

## filtering BioProjects, fetching detailed project information, retrieving and displaying BioSample counts, and processing XML data to extract necessary details. This tool provides a streamlined approach for researchers to access and download essential genomic data from the NCBI database.

## Methodology:
---------------

1. Search Criteria: We input parameters based on the PICO 
Principle to retrieve BioProjects relevant to our search.
PICO stands for: - P ➔(Population) - I ➔ (Interventions) - C ➔ (Comparison) - O ➔ (Outcomes) 

2. Selection Process: Once the search results are returned, you 
can select a BioProject of interest.

3. Biosample Details: Clicking on the selected BioProject 
displays all related biosamples. Each biosample includes links to
both the biosample and the SRA to verify the details.

4. Download FASTQ Files: You can choose a biosample and 
download its corresponding SRA file in FASTQ format.
